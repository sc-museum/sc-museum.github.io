# Signal & Cyber Corps Museum Society — Virtual Museum

The online museum of the **Signal & Cyber Corps Museum Society**, formerly the
Fort Gordon Historical Museum Society — a 501(c)(3) of volunteers preserving the
history of Americans who served at Fort Eisenhower (formerly Fort Gordon), in the
Signal Regiment, and in the Army's Cyber Corps.

**Secure Our Story**

- **Virtual museum:** https://sc-museum.github.io
- **Society:** https://www.signalandcybercorpsmuseum.org/en
- **Donate:** https://givebutter.com/hpEeXi

The Signal Corps Museum on post closed on 25 February 2021 when base construction
took its building, and the collection has been in storage since. The Society is
raising funds to buy and renovate a building outside the gates of Fort
Eisenhower; $250,000 has been donated so far. This virtual museum keeps the collection open to the public meanwhile.

## What is here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The museum itself: a single page whose rooms switch in place. **Built** from the parts below; do not edit it by hand. |
| `rooms/` | One file per room, in floor order: `01-lobby.html` to `16-magazine.html`. Each room's story and content lives here. |
| `src/index.html` | The page shell: head, top bar, pop-up viewers, and placeholders for the rooms, styles, script and data. |
| `css/museum.css`, `js/museum.js` | The museum's styles and behaviour, loaded by the page as files. |
| `data/` | `images.json` (the image registry) and `roster.json` (the Signal Regiment roster), inlined into the page at build time. |
| `assets/` | Photographs, portraits, patches and magazine pages used by the museum rooms. |
| `lineage/` | Mirror of the official lineage, campaign participation credit, and unit citations for the 171 Signal Regiment units in the Command Gallery roster, plus a filterable index. |
| `heritage/` | The Heritage magazine reading room: every issue as readable text and page scans, plus a PDF download of each. |
| `tools/` | Fetch and build scripts for the lineage mirror and the Heritage reading room (`tools/heritage/`), each with its own README. |

## Editing the museum

Each room is its own file in `rooms/`. To change a story, edit that room (or the
styles, script, data or page shell), then rebuild the page:

```bash
perl tools/build-index.pl
```

Commit the rebuilt `index.html` together with your edits. The build check on
GitHub fails a push whose `index.html` is out of date with its parts; run the
build and push again. `perl tools/build-index.pl --check` runs the same check
locally, and `--inline` builds a single self-contained page with the styles and
script inside it.

To add a room, add `rooms/NN-name.html` with a
`<section class="room" id="room-name">`, and a button or map link that
navigates to it with `data-goto="name"`.

## A note on names

This is a history museum, so the two names are not interchangeable and the site
does not treat them as such:

- **Fort Gordon** is kept wherever the record uses it — Camp Gordon in the First
  World War, Fort Gordon as the Signal Corps' home, the 2013 stand-up of the
  Cyber Center of Excellence, and every line of official CMH lineage text.
- **Fort Eisenhower** is used for the present day. The post was redesignated on
  27 October 2023 for General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Likewise **FGHMS** stays on the artifacts that carry it — the Society's own fact
sheets and the pages of *Heritage* — because those are documents, not branding.

## Editing

`index.html` is one large file (~12.8 MB, mostly embedded images). Edit it in
place; there is no build step. The `lineage/` pages are generated — change
`tools/gen-lineage.pl` or `tools/gen-index.pl` and re-run rather than editing the
output by hand. See `tools/README.md`.
